## What is Pinokio Factory?

Pinokio Factory is an experimental community for building on [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer) together.

1. Pinokio Factory is a [Github organization](https://github.com/pinokiofactory), which anyone can apply to join.
2. Once joined, members can freely publish projects under the Pinokio Factory Github organization and discuss with others through Github issues, or through [Pinokio Discord](https://discord.gg/TQdNwadtE4).
3. And once they are ready, the projects can be frozen and officially featured to the entire Pinokio user base.

## Why?

For quality control and security purposes, untrusted projects are NOT featured on Pinokio by default.

This is good, but also means nobody can contribute.

Pinokio Factory is an experiment to try to open up Pinokio so anyone can contribute, while keeping the quality control and security in check.

## How does it work?

Pinokio Factory is an open ended github organization with an experimental workflow aiming to prevent malicious contributions. Here's how it works:

1. **Apply:** Anyone may apply to join. Approved members will be invited to the [Pinokio Factory GitHub Organization](https://github.com/pinokiofactory).
2. **Experiment:** Members may create repositories and publish projects through the organization. At this stage, nothing is featured on Pinokio, and the authors may experiment with whatever they want. They may use the [Pinokio Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TQdNwadtE4) to ask for feedback, and signal when they are ready.
3. **Freeze:** Once the project is ready to be officially published, the repository is frozen. Once frozen, no further code change can happen. Not even by the original author.
4. **Feature:** Once frozen, the projects can be officially featured on Pinokio.
5. **Update:** Since the project is effectively frozen, if anyone wants to make updates to the project (including the original author), they may send a pull request to the repository, and the [organization admin](https://twitter.com/cocktailpeanut) can approve the requests to reflect the updates.
